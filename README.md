# Java Simple Neural Network Multithread

## Overview
This project implements a simple neural network in Java with multithreading capabilities. It aims to demonstrate the core concepts of neural networks including input, output, and network neuron structures, and concurrent processing for improved performance.

## Files Description

- `DavideScolpatiReteNeurale.java`  
  Main class that sets up and runs the neural network.

- `Network.java`  
  Defines the neural network structure and manages the processing of neurons.

- `InputNeuron.java`  
  Represents the input neurons responsible for receiving data into the network.

- `OutputNeuron.java`  
  Represents the output neurons responsible for producing the network's results.

## Features

- Simple feedforward neural network architecture.
- Multithreaded design for concurrent processing of neurons and layers.
- Demonstrates basic neural network components in Java.

## Usage

Clone the repository, then build and run the main class.  
Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
